Welcome to the "One Shot Linear Regression" repository! 🚀 This repository is your gateway to mastering univariate linear regression, a fundamental concept in machine learning and data analysis. Whether you're a beginner eager to learn or an enthusiast looking to solidify your understanding, we're here to make your journey exciting and informative! 🌟

## Introduction 📚

Linear regression is a cornerstone of predictive modeling. In this repository, we dive into the fascinating thing called as **univariate linear regression**, where we predict a target variable using a single input feature. Our mission is clear: demystify linear regression alongside the python code 🐍 to have you know how to implement the concepts as well..

## Getting Started 🏁

1. **Clone this Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saadarazzaq/One-Shot-Linear-Regression.git
   cd One-Shot-Linear-Regression

2. **Install Essential Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Fire Up Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook

## Intuitions 🧠

Build deep intuitions as you:

- Grasp how the model's w and b affect the line's slope and position.
- Explore the connection between data visualization and model accuracy.
- Get hands-on with predictions and understand how they're derived.
